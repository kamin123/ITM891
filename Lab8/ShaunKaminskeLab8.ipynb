        "1. In sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier, there is one argument called \"alpha\" corresponding to the coefficient for the regularization. By default, alpha is equal to 1. There are benefits and drawbacks to having a large alpha. The larger is the alpha, the more likely you are going to have underfitting problems with your graph. Higher alpha does not necessarily mean better results. On the other hand, a low alpha may lead to overfitting problems and a more complicated model. \n",
        "\n",
        "  More information: https://towardsdatascience.com/preventing-overfitting-with-lasso-ridge-and-elastic-net-regularization-in-machine-learning-d1799b05d382\n",
        "\n",
        "  Please try different alpha to train your model and evaluate your model's test accuracy. Note: you cannot try number ranges such as (1-10) or (1-50), these numbers are too similar. (Hint: you'll want try alphas that are different powers of 10.) Out of what you chose, what is the best choice for alpha in MNIST classification?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Instead of fitting the full dimension (784) of data to the RidgeClassifier, you can apply PCA to the data (PCA over X with the shape 10000*784) to reduce the dimension from 784 to 100 (for example) and train another RidgeClassifier with 100-dimension features. \n",
        "\n",
        "  Typically, we want the explained variance to be between 95–99% (which is what we would set n_components to). With alpha=1, iterate through the array 0.95-0.99 ([0.95, 0.96, ...., 0.99]) and set n_components to the value you're currently on in the array. Each time, print the shape of X_reduced to get the number of components that are left from the second value in the tuple. For example, (10000, 168) has 168 components left. For further explanation, see the scikit learn PCA function documentation: \n",
        "  > if 0 < n_components < 1 and svd_solver == ‘full’, select the number of components such that the amount of variance that needs to be explained is greater than the percentage specified by n_components\n",
        " \n",
        "  Then, set n_components to 784 and run again. I should see the results from 0.95-0.99 variance as well as the result of running n_components = 784 in your answer. Then answer this question: what is the best reduced dimension number of components to get the highest test accuracy? (Hint: after applying PCA to 10000 samples, remember to split train and test.)\n",
